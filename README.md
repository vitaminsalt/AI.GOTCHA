# AI-GOTCHA: Conquering Support, One Inquiry at a Time

## Introduction

AI-GOTCHA is an AI-powered assistant designed to help customer support agents handle inquiries faster while ensuring consistent, high-quality service for your customers. At the heart of AI-GOTCHA is **PAY-O**, a clever nod to the Filipino word *Payo*, meaning “advice”—and that’s exactly what it does.

## Features

- **Smart Ticket Handling:**  
  Customer support tickets often come with varied descriptions, even if they relate to the same issue. PAY-O automatically sorts and understands these tickets, assigns priority levels, and suggests the best next steps for agents to recommend. This saves time for both your agents and your customers.

- **Seamless Integration:**  
  AI-GOTCHA easily integrates with mobile wallet apps and other platforms, pulling customer details automatically without requiring repetitive updates for every ticket.

- **Specialized Knowledge:**  
  PAY-O is powered by a Large Language Model customized specifically to respond to inquiries related to digital mobile wallet concerns.

- **Cloud-Native Deployment:**  
  Built entirely on Google Cloud Services and deployed through Firebase Studio, AI-GOTCHA is scalable, reliable, and ready to level up your customer support.
